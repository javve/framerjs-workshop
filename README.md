# Framer workshop 
This workshop is intended for the Mobile Design module at Hyper Island.

## Getting started
1. Download [Framer Studio Free Trial](http://framerjs.com/)
2. Download [Sketch Free Trial](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/).

## Three levels of difficulty
You’ll decide by yourself how challenging this workshop will be. If you feel like staring with the easier levels, feel free to try out the harder ones afterwards.

#### +++ Flying Spaghetti Monster level
* Look at the **expected results gif** and create the same result with Framer + Sketch by yourself. (tips, make print screens of the HI site, only recreate everything in Sketch as a bonus)
#### ++ Unicorn level
* Use the [pre-made Sketch file]() and then create a show-menu-animation in Framer.
#### + Cat level
* Play around with the [pre-made Sketch file]() and the already created [Framer-project](). 

#### Bonus:
Once you’ve completed the challenge feel free to try out some of these bonus challenges:
* Make the active menu blue.
* Make the animation bouncier.
* Recreate the HI mobile site instead of using print screens.
* Use your own imagination!
